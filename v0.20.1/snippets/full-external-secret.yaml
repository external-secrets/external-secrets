  # RefreshPolicy determines how the ExternalSecret should be refreshed.
  # - CreatedOnce: Creates the Secret only if it does not exist and does not update it afterward
  # - Periodic: (default) Synchronizes the Secret at intervals specified by refreshInterval
  # - OnChange: Only synchronizes when the ExternalSecret's metadata or specification changes
  refreshPolicy: Periodic

  # RefreshInterval is the amount of time before the values reading again from the SecretStore provider
  # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h" (from time.ParseDuration)

    # Specifies the ExternalSecret ownership details in the created Secret. Options:
    # - Owner: (default) Creates the Secret and sets .metadata.ownerReferences. If the ExternalSecret is deleted, the Secret will also be deleted.
    # - Merge: Does not create the Secret but merges data fields into the existing Secret (expects the Secret to already exist).
    # - Orphan: Creates the Secret but does not set .metadata.ownerReferences. If the Secret already exists, it will be updated.
    # - None: Does not create or update the Secret (reserved for future use with injector).
    creationPolicy: Merge

    # Specifies what happens to the Secret when data fields are deleted from the provider (e.g., Vault, AWS Parameter Store). Options:
    # - Retain: (default) Retains the Secret if all Secret data fields have been deleted from the provider.
    # - Delete: Removes the Secret if all Secret data fields from the provider are deleted.
    # - Merge: Removes keys from the Secret but not the Secret itself.
