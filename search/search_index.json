The controller fetches secrets from an external API and creates Kubernetes secrets . If the secret from the external API changes, the controller will reconcile the state in the cluster and update the secrets accordingly. Resource model To understand the mechanics of the operator let's start with the data model. The SecretStore references an bucket of key/value pairs. But because every external API is slightly different this bucket may be e.g. an instance of an Azure KeyVault or a AWS Secrets Manager in a certain AWS Account and region. Please take a look at the provider documentation to see what the Bucket actually maps to. SecretStore The idea behind the SecretStore resource is to separate concerns of authentication/access and the actual Secret and configuration needed for workloads. The ExternalSecret specifies what to fetch, the SecretStore specifies how to access. This resource is namespaced. apiVersion : external-secrets.io/v1alpha1 kind : SecretStore metadata : name : secretstore-sample spec : controller : dev provider : aws : service : SecretsManager role : arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/team-a-reader region : us-east-1 auth : secretRef : accessKeyIDSecretRef : name : awssm-secret key : access-key secretAccessKeySecretRef : name : awssm-secret key : secret-access-key The SecretStore contains references to secrets which hold credentials to access the external API. ExternalSecret An ExternalSecret declares what data to fetch. It has a reference to a SecretStore which knows how to access that data. The controller uses that ExternalSecret as a blueprint to create secrets. apiVersion : external-secrets.io/v1alpha1 kind : ExternalSecret metadata : name : example spec : refreshInterval : 1h secretStoreRef : name : secretstore-sample kind : SecretStore target : name : secret-to-be-created creationPolicy : Owner data : - secretKey : secret-key-to-be-managed remoteRef : key : provider-key version : provider-key-version property : provider-key-property dataFrom : - remoteRef : key : remote-key-in-the-provider ClusterSecretStore The ClusterSecretStore is just a global, cluster-wide SecretStore that can be referenced from all namespaces. Behavior The External Secret Operator (ESO for brevity) reconciles ExternalSecrets in the following manner: ESO uses spec.secretStoreRef to find an appropriate SecretStore . If it doesn't exist or the spec.controller field doesn't match it won't further process this ExternalSecret. ESO instanciates an external API client using the specified credentials from the SecretStore spec. ESO fetches the secrets as requested by the ExternalSecret , it will decode the secrets if required ESO creates an Kind=Secret based on the template provided by ExternalSecret.target.template . The Secret.data can be templated using the secret values from the external API. ESO ensures that the secret values stay in sync with the external API Roles and responsibilities The External Secret Operator is designed to target the following persona: Cluster Operator : The cluster operator is responsible for setting up the External Secret Operator, managing access policies and creating ClusterSecretStores. Application developer : The Application developer is responsible for defining ExternalSecrets and the application configuration Each persona will roughly map to a Kubernetes RBAC role. Depending on your environment these roles can map to a single user. Note: There is no Secret Operator that handles the lifecycle of the secret, this is out of the scope of ESO. Access Control The External Secrets Operator runs as a deployment in your cluster with elevated privileges. It will create/read/update secrets in all namespaces and has access to secrets stored in some external API. Ensure that the credentials you provide give ESO the least privilege necessary. Design your SecretStore / ClusterSecretStore carefully! Use annotations on namespaces to restrict access of application developers to read only certain keys in a shared environment. apiVersion : v1 kind : Namespace metadata : name : team-a annotations : # annotation that defines which keys can be read # the annotation value is a regular expression external-secrets.io/permitted-key-name : \"a/development/*\" Not implemented This is currently not yet implemented. Feel free to contribute. You should also consider using Kubernetes' admission control system (e.g. OPA or Kyverno ) for fine-grained access control. Running multiple Controller You can run multiple controller within the cluster. One controller can be limited to only process SecretStores with a predefined spec.controller field.

This guide outlines the flexibility of ESO and should give you a first impression of how you can employ this operator in your organization. For a multi-tenant deployment you should first examine your organizational structure: what roles (i.e. Application Developers , Cluster Admins , ...) do you have in your organization, what responsibilities do they have and how does that map to Kubernetes RBAC roles. Further, you should examine how your external API provider manages access control for your secrets. Can you limit access by secret names (e.g. db/dev/* )? Or only on a bucket level? Please keep in mind that not all external APIs provide fine-grained access management for secrets. Note: The following examples should not be considered as best practice but rather as a example to show how to combine different mechanics and techniques for tenant isolation. Shared ClusterSecretStore A Cluster Administrator deploys a ClusterSecretStore (CSS) and manages access to the external API. The CSS is shared by all tenants within the cluster. Application Developers do reference it in a ExternalSecret but can not create a ClusterSecretStores or SecretStores on their own. Now all application developers have access to all the secrets. You probably want to limit access to certain keys or prefixes that should be used. ESO provides a very simple mechanic to limit access to certain keys on a namespace basis by using annotations on the Kind=Namespace resource. More advanced validation should be done with an Admission Webhook, e.g. with Kyverno or Open Policy Agent ). apiVersion : v1 kind : Namespace metadata : name : team-a annotations : # annotation that defines which keys can be read # the annotation value is a regular expression external-secrets.io/permitted-key-name : \"a/development/*\" This setup suites well if you have one central bucket that contains all of your secrets and your Cluster Administrators should manage access to it. This setup is very simple but does not scale very well. Managed SecretStore per Namespace Cluster Administrators manage one or multipe SecretStores per Namespace. Each SecretStore uses it's own role that limits access to a small set of keys. The peculiarity of this is approach is, that access is actually managed by the external API which provides the roles. The Cluster Administrator does just the wiring. This approach may be desirable if you have an external entity - let's call it Secret Administrator - that manages access and lifecycle of the secrets. ESO as a Service Every namespace is self-contained. Application developers manage SecretStore , ExternalSecret and secret infrastructure on their own. Cluster Administrators just provide the External Secrets Operator as a service.

Field Description tokenSecretRef github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/apis/meta/v1.SecretKeySelector (Optional) TokenSecretRef authenticates with Vault by presenting a token. appRole VaultAppRole (Optional) AppRole authenticates with Vault using the App Role auth mechanism, with the role and secret stored in a Kubernetes Secret resource. kubernetes VaultKubernetesAuth (Optional) Kubernetes authenticates with Vault by passing the ServiceAccount token stored in the named Secret resource to the Vault server. VaultKVStoreVersion ( string alias) ( Appears on: VaultProvider ) Value Description \"v1\" \"v2\" VaultKubernetesAuth ( Appears on: VaultAuth ) Authenticate against Vault using a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token stored in a Secret. Field Description mountPath string Path where the Kubernetes authentication backend is mounted in Vault, e.g: \u201ckubernetes\u201d secretRef github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/apis/meta/v1.SecretKeySelector (Optional) Optional secret field containing a Kubernetes ServiceAccount JWT used for authenticating with Vault. If a name is specified without a key, token is the default. If one is not specified, the one bound to the controller will be used. role string A required field containing the Vault Role to assume. A Role binds a Kubernetes ServiceAccount with a set of Vault policies. VaultProvider ( Appears on: SecretStoreProvider ) Configures an store to sync secrets using a HashiCorp Vault KV backend. Field Description auth VaultAuth Auth configures how secret-manager authenticates with the Vault server. server string Server is the connection address for the Vault server, e.g: \u201c https://vault.example.com:8200\u201d . path string Path is the mount path of the Vault KV backend endpoint, e.g: \u201csecret\u201d. The v2 KV secret engine version specific \u201c/data\u201d path suffix for fetching secrets from Vault is optional and will be appended if not present in specified path. version VaultKVStoreVersion Version is the Vault KV secret engine version. This can be either \u201cv1\u201d or \u201cv2\u201d. Version defaults to \u201cv2\u201d. namespace string (Optional) Name of the vault namespace. Namespaces is a set of features within Vault Enterprise that allows Vault environments to support Secure Multi-tenancy. e.g: \u201cns1\u201d. More about namespaces can be found here https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/namespaces caBundle []byte (Optional) PEM encoded CA bundle used to validate Vault server certificate. Only used if the Server URL is using HTTPS protocol. This parameter is ignored for plain HTTP protocol connection. If not set the system root certificates are used to validate the TLS connection.
