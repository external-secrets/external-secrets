          STSSessionToken uses the GetSessionToken API to retrieve an authorization token.
          The authorization token is valid for 12 hours.
          The authorizationToken returned is a base64 encoded string that can be decoded.
          For more information, see GetSessionToken (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionToken.html).
