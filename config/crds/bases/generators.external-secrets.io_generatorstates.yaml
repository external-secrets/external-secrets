                  GarbageCollectionDeadline is the time after which the generator state
                  will be deleted.
                  It is set by the controller which creates the generator state and
                  can be set configured by the user.
                  If the garbage collection deadline is not set the generator state will not be deleted.

                  Resource is the generator manifest that produced the state.
                  It is a snapshot of the generator manifest at the time the state was produced.
                  This manifest will be used to delete the resource. Any configuration that is referenced
                  in the manifest should be available at the time of garbage collection. If that is not the case deletion will
                  be blocked by a finalizer.
