**External Secrets Operator** is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external
secret management systems like [AWS Secrets
Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [HashiCorp
Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Google Secrets
Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager), [Azure Key
Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/), [Akeyless](https://akeyless.io) and many more. The
operator reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the
values into a [Kubernetes
Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Multiple people and organizations are joining efforts to create a single External Secrets solution based on existing projects. If you are curious about the origins of this project, check out this [issue](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets/issues/47) and this [PR](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets/pull/477).
