## Project Management
The Code, our TODOs and Documentation is maintained on
[GitHub](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets). All Issues
should be opened in that repository.

## Issues

Features, bugs and any issues regarding the documentation should be filed as
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues) in
our repository. We use labels like `kind/feature`, `kind/bug`, `area/aws` to
organize the issues. Issues labeled `good first issue` and `help wanted` are
especially good for a first contribution. If you want to pick up an issue just
leave a comment.

## Submitting a Pull Request

This project uses the well-known pull request process from GitHub. To submit a
pull request, fork the repository and push any changes to a branch on the copy,
from there a pull request can be made in the main repo. Merging a pull request
requires the following steps to be completed before the pull request will
be merged:

* ideally, there is an issue that documents the problem or feature in depth.
* code must have a reasonable amount of test coverage
* tests must pass
* PR needs be reviewed and approved

Once these steps are completed the PR will be merged by a code owner.


## Cutting Releases

As of now this project is in an early alpha phase. There is just the main branch
