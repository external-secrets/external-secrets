# The road to external-secrets GA

The following external-secret custom resource APIs are considered stable:

* `ExternalSecret`
* `ClusterExternalSecret`
* `SecretStore`
* `ClusterSecretStore`

These CRDs are currently at `v1beta1` and are considered production ready. Going forward, breaking changes to these APIs will be accompanied by a conversion mechanism.
