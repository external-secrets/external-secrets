# Advanced Templating v1

!!! warning

    Templating Engine v1 is **deprecated** and will be removed in the future. Please migrate to engine v2 and take a look at our [upgrade guide](guides-templating.md#migrating-from-v1) for changes.


With External Secrets Operator you can transform the data from the external secret provider before it is stored as `Kind=Secret`. You can do this with the `Spec.Target.Template`. Each data value is interpreted as a [golang template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

## Examples

You can use templates to inject your secrets into a configuration file that you mount into your pod:
``` yaml
{% include 'multiline-template-v1-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

You can also use pre-defined functions to extract data from your secrets. Here: extract key/cert from a pkcs12 archive and store it as PEM.
``` yaml
{% include 'pkcs12-template-v1-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

### TemplateFrom

You do not have to define your templates inline in an ExternalSecret but you can pull `ConfigMaps` or other Secrets that contain a template. Consider the following example:

``` yaml
{% include 'template-v1-from-secret.yaml' %}
```

## Helper functions
We provide a bunch of convenience functions that help you transform your secrets. A secret value is a `[]byte`.

| Function       | Description                                                                | Input                            | Output        |
