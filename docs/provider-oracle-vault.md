## Oracle Vault

External Secrets Operator integrates with [OCI API](https://github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk) to sync secret on the Oracle Vault to secrets held on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Authentication

If `auth` is not specified, the operator uses the instance principal.

For using a specific user credentials, userOCID, tenancyOCID, fingerprint and private key are required.
The fingerprint and key file should be supplied in the secret with the rest being provided in the secret store.

See url for what region you you are accessing.

#### Service account key authentication

Create a secret containing your private key and fingerprint:

```yaml
{% include 'oracle-credentials-secret.yaml' %}
```

Your fingerprint will be attatched to your API key, once it has been generated. Found on the same page as the user OCID.

Once you click "Add API Key" you will be shown the following, where you can download the RSA key in the necessary PEM format for API requests.
This will automatically generate a fingerprint.

### Update secret store
Be sure the `oracle` provider is listed in the `Kind=SecretStore`.

```yaml
{% include 'oracle-secret-store.yaml' %}
```

**NOTE:** In case of a `ClusterSecretStore`, Be sure to provide `namespace` in `privatekey` and `fingerprint` with the namespaces where the secrets reside.
### Creating external secret

To create a kubernetes secret from the Oracle Cloud Interface secret a`Kind=ExternalSecret` is needed.

```yaml
{% include 'oracle-external-secret.yaml' %}
```


### Getting the Kubernetes secret
The operator will fetch the project variable and inject it as a `Kind=Secret`.
```
kubectl get secret oracle-secret-to-create -o jsonpath='{.data.dev-secret-test}' | base64 -d
```
