## Installing CRDs

This project provides a collection of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that
can be installed into any Kubernetes (>= 1.16) cluster.

To install the CRDs, please execute:

``` bash
kubectl kustomize "github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/config/crd" \
| kubectl apply -f -
```

## Install the controller

``` bash
kubectl kustomize "github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/config/default" \
| kubectl apply -f -
```

### Create your first SecretStore

``` yaml
{% include 'basic-secret-store.yaml' %}
```

### Create your first ExternalSecret

``` yaml
{% include 'basic-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

``` bash
kubectl describe externalsecret example
# [...]
Name:  example

[guides](guides-introduction.md).

## Uninstalling the CRDs

To uninstall the CRDs and all resources created with them, run the following
command. Note that this will remove all ExternalSecrets and SecretStore
resources in your cluster. If you have been using these resources for any other
purpose do not uninstall these CRDs.

```
kubectl kustomize "github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/config/crd" \
| kubectl delete -f -
```
