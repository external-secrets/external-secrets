GCRAccessToken creates a GCP Access token that can be used to authenticate with GCR in order to pull OCI images. You won't need any extra permissions to request for a token, but the token would only work against a GCR if the token requester (service Account or WI) has the appropriate access

You must specify the `spec.projectID` in which GCR is located.
