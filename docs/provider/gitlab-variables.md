## Gitlab Variables

External Secrets Operator integrates with Gitlab to sync [Gitlab Project Variables API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_level_variables.html) and/or [Gitlab Group Variables API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/group_level_variables.html) to secrets held on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Configuring Gitlab

The Gitlab API requires an access token, project ID and/or groupIDs.

To create a new access token, go to your user settings and select 'access tokens'. Give your token a name, expiration date, and select the permissions required (Note 'api' is required).

Click 'Create personal access token', and your token will be generated and displayed on screen. Copy or save this token since you can't access it again.

### Access Token secret

Create a secret containing your access token:

```yaml
{% include 'gitlab-credentials-secret.yaml' %}
```

### Configuring the secret store
Be sure the `gitlab` provider is listed in the `Kind=SecretStore` and the ProjectID is set. If you are not using `https://gitlab.com`, you must set the `url` field as well.

In order to sync group variables `inheritFromGroups` must be true or `groupIDs` have to be defined.

In case you have defined multiple environments in Gitlab, the secret store should be constrained to a specific `environment_scope`.

```yaml
{% include 'gitlab-secret-store.yaml' %}
```
**NOTE:** In case of a `ClusterSecretStore`, Be sure to provide `namespace` in `accessToken` with the namespace where the secret resides.

Your project ID can be found on your project's page.

### Creating external secret

To sync a Gitlab variable to a secret on the Kubernetes cluster, a `Kind=ExternalSecret` is needed.

```yaml
{% include 'gitlab-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

#### Using DataFrom

DataFrom can be used to get a variable as a JSON string and attempt to parse it.

```yaml
{% include 'gitlab-external-secret-json.yaml' %}
```

### Getting the Kubernetes secret
The operator will fetch the project variable and inject it as a `Kind=Secret`.
```
kubectl get secret gitlab-secret-to-create -o jsonpath='{.data.secretKey}' | base64 -d
```
