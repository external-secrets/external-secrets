## Google Cloud Secret Manager

External Secrets Operator integrates with [GCP Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) for secret management.

## Authentication

### Workload Identity

Your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) applications can consume GCP services like Secrets Manager without using static, long-lived authentication tokens. This is our recommended approach of handling credentials in GCP. ESO offers two options for integrating with GKE workload identity: **pod-based workload identity** and **using service accounts directly**. Before using either way you need to create a service account - this is covered below.

#### Creating Workload Identity Service Accounts

You can find the documentation for Workload Identity [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity). We will walk you through how to navigate it here.

Search [the document](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) for this editable values and change them to your values:  
_Note: If you have installed ESO, a serviceaccount has already been created. You can either patch the existing `external-secrets` SA or create a new one that fits your needs._

- `CLUSTER_NAME`: The name of your cluster
- `PROJECT_ID`: Your project ID (not your Project number nor your Project name)
- `K8S_NAMESPACE`: For us following these steps here it will be `es`, but this will be the namespace where you deployed the external-secrets operator
- `KSA_NAME`: external-secrets (if you are not creating a new one to attach to the deployment)
- `GSA_NAME`: external-secrets for simplicity, or something else if you have to follow different naming convetions for cloud resources
- `ROLE_NAME`: should be `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` - so you make the pod only be able to access secrets on Secret Manager

#### Using Service Accounts directly

Let's assume you have created a service account correctly and attached a appropriate workload identity. It should roughly look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: external-secrets
  namespace: es
  annotations:
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: example-team-a@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

You can reference this particular ServiceAccount in a `SecretStore` or `ClusterSecretStore`. It's important that you also set the `projectID`, `clusterLocation` and `clusterName`. The Namespace on the `serviceAccountRef` is ignored when using a `SecretStore` resource. This is needed to isolate the namespaces properly.

```yaml
{% include 'gcpsm-wi-secret-store.yaml' %}
```

*You need to give the Google service account the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role so it can generate a service account token for you (not necessary in the Pod-based Workload Identity bellow)*

#### Using Pod-based Workload Identity

You can attach a Workload Identity directly to the ESO pod. ESO then has access to all the APIs defined in the attached service account policy. You attach the workload identity by (1) creating a service account with a attached workload identity (described above) and (2) using this particular service account in the pod's `serviceAccountName` field.

For this example we will assume that you installed ESO using helm and that you named the chart installation `external-secrets` and the namespace where it lives `es` like:

```sh
helm install external-secrets external-secrets/external-secrets --namespace es
```

Then most of the resources would have this name, the important one here being the k8s service account attached to the external-secrets operator deployment:

```yaml
# ...
      containers:
      - image: ghcr.io/external-secrets/external-secrets:vVERSION
        name: external-secrets
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      serviceAccount: external-secrets
      serviceAccountName: external-secrets # <--- here
```

The pod now has the identity. Now you need to configure the `SecretStore`.
You just need to set the `projectID`, all other fields can be omitted.

```yaml
{% include 'gcpsm-pod-wi-secret-store.yaml' %}
```

### GCP Service Account authentication

You can use [GCP Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to authenticate with GCP. These are static, long-lived credentials. A GCP Service Account is a JSON file that needs to be stored in a `Kind=Secret`. ESO will use that Secret to authenticate with GCP. See here how you [manage GCP Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

```yaml
{% include 'gcpsm-credentials-secret.yaml' %}
```


#### Update secret store
Be sure the `gcpsm` provider is listed in the `Kind=SecretStore`

```yaml
{% include 'gcpsm-secret-store.yaml' %}
```

**NOTE:** In case of a `ClusterSecretStore`, Be sure to provide `namespace` for `SecretAccessKeyRef` with the namespace of the secret that we just created.

#### Creating external secret

To create a kubernetes secret from the GCP Secret Manager secret a `Kind=ExternalSecret` is needed.

```yaml
{% include 'gcpsm-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

The operator will fetch the GCP Secret Manager secret and inject it as a `Kind=Secret`
```
kubectl get secret secret-to-be-created -n <namespace> | -o jsonpath='{.data.dev-secret-test}' | base64 -d
```
