## Conjur Provider

The following sections outline what is needed to get your external-secrets Conjur provider setup.

### Pre-requirements

This section contains the list of the pre-requirements before installing the Conjur Provider.

*   Running Conjur Server
    -   These items will be needed in order to configure the secret-store
        +   Conjur endpoint - include the scheme but no trailing '/', ex: https://myapi.example.com
        +   Conjur credentials (hostid, apikey)
        +   Certificate for Conjur server is OPTIONAL -- But, **when using a self-signed cert when setting up your Conjur server, it is strongly recommended to populate "caBundle" with self-signed cert in the secret-store definition**
*   Kubernetes cluster
    -   External Secrets Operator is installed

### Create External Secret Store Definition

Recommend to save as filename: `conjur-secret-store.yaml`

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-secret-store.yaml' %}
```

### Create External Secret Definition

Important note: **Creds must live in the same namespace as a SecretStore  - the secret store may only reference secrets from the same namespace.**  When using a ClusterSecretStore this limitation is lifted and the creds can live in any namespace.

Recommend to save as filename: `conjur-external-secret.yaml`

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

### Create Kubernetes Secrets

In order for the ESO **Conjur** provider to connect to the Conjur server, the creds should be stored as k8s secrets.  Please refer to <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret> for various methods to create secrets.  Here is one way to do it using `kubectl`

***NOTE***: "conjur-creds" is the "name" used in "userRef" and "apikeyRef" in the conjur-secret-store definition

```shell
# This is all one line
kubectl -n external-secrets create secret generic conjur-creds --from-literal=hostid=MYCONJURHOSTID --from-literal=apikey=MYAPIKEY

# Example:
# kubectl -n external-secrets create secret generic conjur-creds --from-literal=hostid=host/data/app1/host001 --from-literal=apikey=321blahblah
```

### Create the External Secrets Store

```shell
# WARNING: this will create the store configuration in the "external-secrets" namespace, adjust this to your own situation
#
kubectl apply -n external-secrets -f conjur-secret-store.yaml

# WARNING: running the delete command will delete the secret store configuration
#
# If there is a need to delete the external secretstore
# kubectl delete secretstore -n external-secrets conjur
```

### Create the External Secret

```shell
# WARNING: this will create the external-secret configuration in the "external-secrets" namespace, adjust this to your own situation
#
kubectl apply -n external-secrets -f conjur-external-secret.yaml

# WARNING: running the delete command will delete the external-secrets configuration
#
# If there is a need to delete the external secret
# kubectl delete externalsecret -n external-secrets conjur
```

### Getting the K8S Secret

* Login to your Conjur server and verify that your secret exists
* Review the value of your Kubernetes secret to see that it contains the same value from Conjur

```shell
# WARNING: this command will reveal the stored secret in plain text
#
# Assuming the secret name is "secret00", this will show the value
kubectl get secret -n external-secrets conjur -o jsonpath="{.data.secret00}"  | base64 --decode && echo
```
