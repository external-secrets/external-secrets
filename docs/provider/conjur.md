## Conjur Provider

This section describes how to set up the Conjur provider for External Secrets Operator (ESO). For a working example, see the [Accelerator-K8s-External-Secrets repo](https://github.com/conjurdemos/Accelerator-K8s-External-Secrets).

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Conjur provider, you need:

*   A running Conjur Server, with:
    *   An accessible Conjur endpoint (for example: `https://myapi.example.com`).
    *   Your configured Conjur authentication info (such as `hostid`, `apikey`, or JWT service ID). For more information on configuring Conjur, see [Policy statement reference](https://docs.cyberark.com/conjur-open-source/Latest/en/Content/Operations/Policy/policy-statement-ref.htm).
    *   Support for your authentication method (`apikey` is supported by default, `jwt` requires additional configuration).
    *   **Optional**: Conjur server certificate (see [below](#conjur-server-certificate)).
*   A Kubernetes cluster with ESO installed.

### Conjur server certificate

If you set up your Conjur server with a self-signed certificate, we recommend that you populate the `caBundle` field with the Conjur self-signed certificate in the secret-store definition. The certificate CA must be referenced in the secret-store definition using either `caBundle` or `caProvider`:

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-ca-bundle.yaml' %}
```

### External secret store with apiKey authentication

This method uses a Conjur `hostid` and `apikey` to authenticate with Conjur. It is the simplest method to set up and use because your Conjur instance requires no additional configuration.

#### Step 1: Create an external secret store

!!! Tip
    Save as the file as: `conjur-secret-store.yaml`

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-secret-store-apikey.yaml' %}
```

#### Step 2: Create Kubernetes secrets

To connect to the Conjur server, the **ESO Conjur provider** needs to retrieve the `apikey` credentials from K8s secrets.

!!! Note
    For more information about how to create K8s secrets, see [Creating a secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret).

Here is an example of how to create K8s secrets using the `kubectl` command:

```shell
# This is all one line
kubectl -n external-secrets create secret generic conjur-creds --from-literal=hostid=MYCONJURHOSTID --from-literal=apikey=MYAPIKEY

# Example:
# kubectl -n external-secrets create secret generic conjur-creds --from-literal=hostid=host/data/app1/host001 --from-literal=apikey=321blahblah
```

!!! Note
    `conjur-creds` is the `name` defined in the `userRef` and `apikeyRef` fields of the `conjur-secret-store.yml` file.

### External secret store with JWT authentication

This method uses JWT tokens to authenticate with Conjur. You can use the following methods to retrieve a JWT token for authentication:

-  JWT token from a referenced Kubernetes service account
-  JWT token stored in a Kubernetes secret

#### Step 1: Define an external secret store

When you use JWT authentication, the following must be specified in the `SecretStore`:

- `account` -  The name of the Conjur account
- `serviceId` - The ID of the JWT Authenticator `WebService` configured in Conjur that is used to authenticate the JWT token

You can retrieve the JWT token from either a referenced service account or a Kubernetes secret.

For example, to retrieve a JWT token from a referenced Kubernetes service account, the following secret store definition can be used:

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-secret-store-jwt-service-account-ref.yaml' %}
```

!!! Important
    This method is only supported in Kubernetes 1.22 and above as it uses the [TokenRequest API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-request-v1/) to get the JWT token from the referenced service account. Audiences can be defined in the [Conjur JWT authenticator](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Integrations/k8s-ocp/k8s-jwt-authn.htm).

Alternatively, here is an example where a secret containing a valid JWT token is referenced:

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-secret-store-jwt-secret-ref.yaml' %}
```

The JWT token must identify your Conjur host, be compatible with your configured Conjur JWT authenticator, and meet all the [Conjur JWT guidelines](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Operations/Services/cjr-authn-jwt-guidelines.htm#Best).

You can use an external JWT issuer or the Kubernetes API server to create the token. For example, a Kubernetes service account token can be created with this command:

```shell
kubectl create token my-service-account --audience='https://conjur.company.com' --duration=3600s
```

Save the secret store file as `conjur-secret-store.yaml` (the filename used in subsequent steps).

#### Step 2: Define an external secret

Save the external secret file as: `conjur-external-secret.yaml`

```yaml
{% include 'conjur-external-secret.yaml' %}
```

!!!Important
    Unless you are using a [ClusterSecretStore](../api/clustersecretstore.md), credentials must reside in the same namespace as the SecretStore.

#### Step 3: Create the external secrets store

```shell
# WARNING: creates the store in the "external-secrets" namespace, update the value as needed
#
kubectl apply -n external-secrets -f conjur-secret-store.yaml

# WARNING: running the delete command will delete the secret store configuration
#
# If there is a need to delete the external secretstore
# kubectl delete secretstore -n external-secrets conjur
```

#### Step 4: Create the external secret

```shell
# WARNING: creates the external-secret in the "external-secrets" namespace, update the value as needed
#
kubectl apply -n external-secrets -f conjur-external-secret.yaml

# WARNING: running the delete command will delete the external-secrets configuration
#
# If there is a need to delete the external secret
# kubectl delete externalsecret -n external-secrets conjur
```

#### Step 5: Get the K8s secret

* Log in to your Conjur server and verify that your secret exists
* Review the value of your Kubernetes secret to verify that it contains the same value as the Conjur server

```shell
# WARNING: this command will reveal the stored secret in plain text
#
# Assuming the secret name is "secret00", this will show the value
kubectl get secret -n external-secrets conjur -o jsonpath="{.data.secret00}"  | base64 --decode && echo
```
