# Introduction

![high-level](./pictures/diagrams-high-level-simple.png)

**External Secrets Operator** is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external
secret management systems like [AWS Secrets
Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [HashiCorp
Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Google Secrets
Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager), [Azure Key
Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) and many more. The
operator reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the
values into a [Kubernetes
Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

### What is the goal of External Secrets Operator?

The goal of External Secrets Operator is to synchronize secrets from external
APIs into Kubernetes. ESO is a collection of custom API resources -
`ExternalSecret`, `SecretStore` and `ClusterSecretStore` that provide a
user-friendly abstraction for the external API that stores and manages the
lifecycle of the secrets for you.
